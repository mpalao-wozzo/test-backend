# graphql-back-boilerplate

graphql-back-boilerplate is a NodeJS project created by Wozzo [![Wozzo](https://www.wozzo.es/favicon.ico 'Wozzo')](https://www.wozzo.es) using Node JS and GraphQL.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and ready to start a new project.

### Clone the project with ssh

‚ö†Ô∏è If you have not ssh configured on you github look at [this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

Open your terminal, go to the folder where you want to clone the project and use the following code

```
git clone git@github.com:wozzocomp/graphql-back-boilerplate.git
```

### Prerequisites

1. Install Homebrew

   Open terminal and paste this command

   ```
   /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
   ```

2. Install Node and NPM

   First Install XCode development software.

   Open Terminal and run this command:

   ```
   brew install node
   ```

   Check is Node is installed with this command

   ```
   node -v
   ```

   Check is NPM is installed with this command

   ```
   npm -v
   ```

3. Install MongoDB

   Open Terminal and paste this command:

   ```
   brew install mongodb
   ```

   After downloading Mongo, create the 'db' directory. This is where the Mongo data files will live. You can create the directory in the default location by running

   ```
   mkdir -p /data/db
   ```

   Make sure that the /data/db directory has the right permissions by running

   ```
   sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db
   ```

   Run the Mongo daemon

   ```
   mongod
   ```

   Run the Mongo shell, with the Mongo daemon running in one terminal, type mongo in another terminal window. This will run the Mongo shell which is an application to access data in MongoDB.

   To exit the Mongo shell run `quit()`

   To stop the Mongo daemon hit ctrl-c

4. Create the .env files

   You need to create the **.env** file in the root of the project

   ```
   /graphql-back-boilerplate/.env
   ```

   and now add this lines to the file:

   ```
   SECRET=secret
   FRONTEND_URL=http://YOUR_IP:FONTEND_PORT (Example: http://192.168.1.35:3001)
   MONGO_URI=localhost:27017
   ```


    ‚ö†Ô∏è Contact with a project admin to know the correct credentials.
